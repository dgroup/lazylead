integrated into our processes and everyone understands their necessity. As soon
as a developer becomes a lead/technical manager, he or she faces a set of
routine tasks that are related to ticketing work. On large projects this becomes
 a problem, more and more you spend time running around on dashboards and
tickets, looking for incorrect deviations in tickets and performing routine
tasks instead of solving technical problems."
